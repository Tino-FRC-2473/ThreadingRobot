# ThreadingRobot
### A framework to install that prevents the need to copy and paste complicated threading and networking code repeatedly.

When subclassing ThreadingRobot, the average code length is **less than half** of the code length when sublcassing IterativeRobot.

### Features
- Massively reduced code size
- Built in networking and threading support
- Able to run on any roboRIO centered system, from a single motor to a full robot
- Increased readability of code
- Increased ease of implementation

### Roadmap
#### Version 2.0
- Method access limited only to used methods, rest are package private, or protected.
- Increased error handling and reporting.
- API docs for framework developers.
- BooleanSupplier listener support
- StringSupplier listener support
- More convenient naming of parameters.

#### Version 3.0
- Integrated Software Generator for less experienced programmers.
- Implement interfaces in architecture to promote use of certain methods.
